## Description: 
### Objetive: 
To calculate the instrumental variable estimator, when the number of instruments is equal to the number of endogenous variables. In addition, we calculate the covariance matrix of the estimator.
* The chosen database is ["Cigarette Consumption Panel Data" ](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/AER/versions/1.2-9/topics/CigarettesSW)
